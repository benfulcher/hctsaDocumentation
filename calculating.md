# Running Computations
<!--{#sec:calculating}-->

An *hctsa* analysis requires setting a library of time series, master operations and operations, and generates a `HCTSA.mat` file (using `TS_Init`), as described [here](input_files.md).
Once this is set up, computations are run using [`TS_Compute`](running_computations.md).

These steps, as well as information on how to [inspect the results of an *hctsa* analysis](dealing_with_errors.md) and [working with HCTSA*.mat files](working_with_hctsa_files), are provided in this chapter.
