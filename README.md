# Manual for *hctsa*

This document outlines steps required to set up and implement highly comparative analysis methods on a system using an interface between Matlab and a _mySQL_ database using the [*hctsa* package](https://github.com/SystemsAndSignalsGroup/hctsa).
This manual is an accompaniment this software.
It will take you through the steps required to run highly comparative time-series analysis, as described in our papers:
