# Highly Comparative Time-Series Analysis Manual
A guide to implementing the techniques and methods developed in _Highly Comparative Time-Series Analysis_ using an interface between Matlab and a *mySQL* server.
This manual takes you through the steps required to run highly comparative time-series analysis, as described in our papers:

## Overview
This document outlines steps required to set up and implement highly comparative analysis methods on a system using an interface between Matlab and a _mySQL_ database using the [highly comparative time-series analysis repository](https://github.com/SystemsAndSignalsGroup/hctsa).
