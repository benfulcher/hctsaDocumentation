# Assigning group labels to data

_hctsa_ allows you to map time-series data into a unified feature space, a representation that is well suited to then applying machine learning methods to perform classification where the goal is to predict a class label assigned to each time series from features of its dynamics.

Class labels can be assigned to time series in an _hctsa_ dataset using the function `TS_LabelGroups`, which populates the `Group` column of the `TimeSeries` table as a categorical labeling of the data \(the class labels the classifier will attempt to predict\). These group labels are used by a range of analysis functions, including `TS_PlotLowDim`, `TS_TopFeatures`, and `TS_Classify`.

The machinery of `TS_LabelGroups` assumes that the class labels you are interested in are contained in the `Keywords` column of the `TimeSeries` table \(set up from your original [input file](../calculating/input_files.md) when `TS_Init` was run\).

## Labeling

### Manual labeling

If you want to label according to a specific set of keywords, you can do this by specifying the keywords that define the unique groups. The example below assigns labels to two groups of time series in the `HCTSA.mat` \(specifying the shorthand `'raw'` for this default, un-normalized data\), corresponding to those labeled as `'parkinsons'` and those labeled as `'healthy'`:

```text
TS_LabelGroups('raw',{'parkinsons','healthy'});
```

Note that any time series that are not labeling by either `'parkinsons'` nor `'healthy'` are left unlabeled.

### Automatic labeling

If every time series has a single keyword that uniquely labels it, `TS_LabelGroups` can automatically detect this by running `TS_LabelGroups('raw',{});`.

### Complex labeling

More complex labeling \(e.g., using custom combinations of keywords\) is not implemented in `TS_LabelGroups`, but can be achieved by writing a script that does logical operations on calls to `TS_LabelGroups` and saves back to the `TimeSeries.Group` column. Here is [an example](https://github.com/benfulcher/hctsa_phenotypingFly/blob/master/labelCombination.m) of combining two labels \(male/female and day/night\) on fly movement data.

## Working with labels

By default, the group labels are saved back to the data file \(in this example, `HCTSA.mat`\).

Group labels can be reassigned at any time by re-running the `TS_LabelGroups` function, and can be cleared by running, e.g., `TS_LabelGroups('raw','clear')`.

Assigned labels are used by the analysis, plotting, and classification functions of _hctsa_.

_Note_: If you assign a labeling to a given dataset \(e.g., `HCTSA.mat`\), then this labeling will remain with the normalized data \(e.g., after running `TS_Normalize`\).
