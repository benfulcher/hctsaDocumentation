# Running hctsa computations

An _hctsa_ analysis requires setting a library of time series, master operations and operations, and generates a `HCTSA.mat` file \(using `TS_Init`\), as described [here](input_files.md). Once this is set up, computations are run using [`TS_Compute`](running_computations.md).

These steps, as well as information on how to [inspect the results of an _hctsa_ analysis](dealing_with_errors.md) and [working with HCTSA\*.mat files](https://github.com/benfulcher/hctsaDocumentation/tree/71794292cac125d96004eacd0c1934c6feacd36b/working_with_hctsa_files/README.md), are provided in this chapter.
