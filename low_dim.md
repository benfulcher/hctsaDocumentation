# Low dimensional representations

The software also provides a basic means of visualizing low-dimensional representations of the data, using PCA as `TSQ_plot_pca`.

This can be done for a time-series dataset as follows:

    TSQ_plot_pca('norm','ts')
    
By default, the user will be prompted to select 10 points on the plot to annotate with time series.
After selecting 10 points, we have the following:
